## Zettelkasten Apps

### Overview

- Architecture after Luhmann's Zettelkasten.
    - The Zettelkasten method in [English](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/).
    - The Zettelkasten method in [German](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/nachlass/zettelkasten).
    - Another term for the Zettelkasten is the [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/).
- Current implementations.
    - A [Java](http://zettelkasten.danielluedecke.de/) implementation of the Zettelkasten with an old-school user interface.
    - [Neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron), a Haskell implementation. Very cool project, also uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [Matrix](https://matrix.org/). [Emanote](https://github.com/srid/emanote), a currently, seemingly, less popular successor to Neuron by the same author.
    - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a proprietary, cross-platform, markdown-based note taking tool. With a focus on cross-references and building a knowledge graph it's similar to the Zettelkasten. Other similar proprietary apps are [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) (client is open source), [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), [RemNote](https://www.remnote.com/) with support for flash cards.
    - [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) is an open source Obsidian clone. Markdown based format. Supports mobile and dekstop.
    - [AppFlowy.IO](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy) is a Notion clone. The tech stack is in Rust and Dart/Flutter. The project is in early development as of November 2021 but gaining popularity rapidly with over 8k stars on GitHub. The project is open source and AGPL-3 licensed. This could be the most promising project in the future. Due to Flutter multi platform comes per default.
    - [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) is a Roam based VSCode extension.
    - Don't allow linking to subsections of a Zettel. A Zettel should be atomic and KISS.
- Editor.
    - The system should be usable even when limited to only sending text messages to your Zettelkasten.
    - The system should feel as plastic and haptic as possible.
    - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a dekstop and web supported text-editor with extensions.
    - [Zettlr](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr) is a desktop-only TypeScript based Zettelkasten enabled Markdown note-taking app.
    - [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/) is a web-mobile-desktop TypeScript-based note taking app with paid syncing options. [Standard Notes](https://github.com/standardnotes) seems similar but a bit worse. Joplin has a [plugin](https://github.com/joplin/plugins) repository with some Zettelkasten and flash card related functions.
        - A graph visualization of the connectome of notes is given [here](https://github.com/treymo/joplin-link-graph).
        - Backlinks, listing all references to a current note, is supported [here](https://github.com/ambrt/joplin-plugin-referencing-notes). The functionality is explained [here](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/automatic-backlinks-with-manual-insert-option/13632).
        - [Exporting notes](https://github.com/BartBucknill/joplin-to-anki) with Q/A pairs to [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) for flash card functionality.
        - Automatically recognizing possible references in a note to other notes and creating links, [here](https://github.com/S73ph4n/joplin_make_all_links).
        - Quickly linking notes by their title, on [GitHub](https://github.com/roman-r-m/joplin-plugin-quick-links), discussion [here](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/quick-links-plugin/14214). [This](https://github.com/S73ph4n/joplin_complete_link) plugin does something similar. And [this](https://github.com/S73ph4n/joplin_autolinker) plugin also.
        - Multiple [note tabs](https://github.com/benji300/joplin-note-tabs).
        
    - [FSNotes](https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes) is a iOS and Mac only note taking app in Swift.
    - 3D representation and VR with the Zettelkasten.
- UI.
    - The UI is a key component.
    - Touch optimized.
    - Keyboard optimized.
    - Expand on horizontal stacking for multiple Zettel as in Obsidian.
        - Freedom of [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/).
    - Natural flow between one viewing mode into the other. 
- Export and import to and from many formats.
    - Import from a collection of .md files such as maintained with Obsidian.
    - Import from a loose collection of data .odt, .doc, docx. Use NLP and clustering for creating Zettel.
    - Import from services such as EverNote, OneNote.
    - Export entire Zettelkasten.
        - To database dump.
        - To collection of markdown files.
        - To a single PDF or to a collection of PDFs by filters.
        - To EPUB.
        - To JSON.
- Visualization: Support for mind map or tree generation.
    - Visualize markdown as a tree. Implemented in [Typescript](https://github.com/gera2ld/markmap).
        - Available as extension in [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gera2ld.markmap-vscode).
    - Mind map software in [Javascript](https://github.com/ondras/my-mind).
    - Alternative mind map software in [Javascript](https://github.com/drichard/mindmaps).
    - [Diagrams.net](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) formerly Draw.io is a general purpose diagramming software.
    - Visualization should allow (1) eagle-view of all nodes (2) filtering for incoming nodes of some node (3) filtering for outgoing nodes of some node.
    - 3D-printable topological map of the Zettelkasten.
- Learning: Support for flash card generation.
    - Memcode is a flashcard webapp written in [Javascript](https://github.com/lakesare/memcode).
    - Anki consists of an open source [desktop app](https://github.com/ankitects/anki), [Android app](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android), and a proprietary [web app](https://ankiweb.net/about) and [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387).
    - AI-feature to convert a Zettel to a closure flashcard or to formulate a question that is answered by the Zettel. Separate label for AI-generated questions/closures. Allow regeneration and user-selection of best generation.
    - Active recall learning with spaced repetition on a subset of Zettel.
- Blogging: Support for publishing a collection of Zettel to the web.
    - See this [example](https://alien-psychology.zettel.page/) generated from notes about a TV-show using the Neuron app.
    - See this [example](https://publish.obsidian.md/myquantumwell/Welcome+to+The+Quantum+Well!) generated from Obsidian publish.
- Search and filtering.
    - Test multiple search algorithms.
    - Strive for something like Google's MUM: Multimodal search with for example auto-generated labels for images in a Zettel.
    - Chronological view of the Zettel creation history.
    - Visualization of meta-information. For example zettel creation frequency.
- Labels/Tags as feature-controllers and as filters for a Zettel.
    - Example: filtering by a diary-label, university-label or a specific course-label.
    - Example: Generating a Flashcard from a Zettel should only be possible when a flashcard-label is present and a question or closure can be located on the Zettel. 
- Support for news.
    - Receive updates on topics inside your Zettelkasten from the Web.
    - Configure sources: Google, Google Scholar, Reddit, NY Times, The Economist, Twitter, Nature, Science, The Lancet.
    - Receive news from (1) manually selected and filtered Zettel (2) most recent Zettel (3) most connected Zettel (4) most referencing Zettel (5) most referenced Zettel.
    - Automatic Zettel creation from a news article using AI an generated modifiable summary. Includes automatic reference to article.
- Multi-modal data support: vector-graphics-canvas, text, 2D images, 3D images, latex, code, audio, 2D video, 3D videos.
    - In the long run, code execution for many programming languages could be possible with WebAssembly. In the short term remote code execution could be offered as a service. 
    - To integrate sketching see [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).
    - AI tools to generate multi-modal. For example automatic transcription of voice recordings.
    - Integrate arbitrary external documents.
        - Example: Allow loading a paper's full PDF into the database. Clicking on a reference then opens the PDF.
- Multi-note and multi-user support for synchronous and asynchronous editing.
    - View, edit and delete multiple local Zettel at the same time.
    - Share Zettel with other users. Push and pull synchronization similar to git with remote Zettelkasten.
    - Mount remote Zettelkasten giving the option to pull. Or clone making an independent, non-updating copy. Automatic cache before pulling with option to sever ties to remote Zettelkasten on a given set of nodes.
- Uses a database to grow a lifetime.
    - [SQlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a database but not overkill. Concurrency relies on file-locking. This is [acceptable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5102027/can-sqlite-support-multiple-users) for a small number of concurrent users. 
- Prototype/MVP in HTML, CSS, Javascript targeting web.
    - Could be packaged with [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) for desktop apps.
    - Could be packaged with Ionic's [Capacitor](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor) for mobile.
- VR.
    - There is a rich ecosystem of note taking, learning, productivity management, knowledge management and collaboration apps.
    - VR will grow a lot in the future.
    - Remove tradeoffs between the physical and the digital Zettelkasten.
    - Visualizations and knowledge in the 3D dimension are more comprehensive.
    - Needs a game engine.
        - [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot). An [article](https://godotengine.org/article/why-isnt-godot-ecs-based-game-engine) about why it isn't Entity Component System (ECS) based.
        - [Unity](https://unity.com/de) seems the most fully featured and advanced game engine.
    - WebGL supports XR via the [WebXR Device API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/)
    - Tradeoffs between 3D, 2D and speech/audio interactions and views, [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0097849319300974), [doi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2019.06.003).
- An advanced app could be in Dart/[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) targeting mobile, desktop, web.
- Cross-platform and synchronized.
    - Centralized synching as a service.
    - Centralized synchronization via external Clouds such as Nextcloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive.
    - Local syncing via [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing).
- Reconstruction.
    - You only learnt about the Zettelkasten after finishing university. How to add everything?
    - You text people great ideas. But this was all before the Zettelkasten. How to aggregate it all?
- Grammatical note: In German's Nominative case it's "1 Zettel, 2 Zettel" but English doesn't have cases and "1 Zettel, 2 Zettels" sounds kind of natural in English.
- AI-it-up.
    - Sentiment analysis.
    - NLP.
    - Text completion aid.
    - Text regularization by recognizing patters. For example aligning year_month and month_year occurrences into one.
- Questions
    - Labels and folders?
        - Are they really good or are they a bad idea?
        - There is a natural tendency to want to use folders.
        - There is a natural tendency to want to use labels.
        - But why wouldn't that just be represented by nodes?
            - Example: A label for your linear-algebra course?
            - The advantage: allows focusing on a specific set of nodes that can otherwise not as easily be selected. Do we want to link each node related to the course to the main topic? No we don't. We don't want to have to link matrix-multiplication to linear algebra. It's already connected to matrices which in turn are connected to linear algebra. Or maybe there is something here about path length enabled filtering that is superior to labels, because technically it would be more atomic and minimalistic to avoid labels/tags. Or if tags are implemented, then that they are just syntactic sugar around actually just a link to an existing Zettel.
    - Links to sections within a Zettel, for example referring to second subheading?
        - Con: this encourages large Zettels
        - A Zettel should be 1-3 questions and one coherent answer
        - Pro: Obsidian supports this and it doesn't feel too bad.
        - Discussion: Sub-linking could encourage writing reports and essays inside the Zettelkasten. Of course, it's possible to write big documents inside the Zettelkasten without sub-linkink. However such documents should be an aggregation and therefore reference a lot instead of being sources and therefore being referenced a lot.
- Decentralized governance and infrastructure.
    - Use [Filecoin (FIL)](https://filecoin.io/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) for storage.
    - Use [Internet Computer (ICP)](https://dfinity.org/) for compute.
    - Use [The Graph (GRT)](https://thegraph.com/en/) for indexing.
- Multi-view read and write
    - For example write flash card -> it's inside a linear text -> it's inside a Zettel
    - Write a Zettel -> it's a flash card -> it's inside a linear text or summary
    - Write a summary or linear text -> it's converted to atomic Zettels -> it's converted to flash cards
- What file saving model?
    - One file dump?
    - Files per zettel?
    - folder per zettel?
- How to make links?
    - Numbers
    - ids
    - names

- An example of powerful Obsidian usage is given by [Ryan Murphy](https://twitter.com/ryanjamurphy), a PhD in management. Ryan uses Obsidian on an iPad.

More on [Fulcra](https://fulcra.design/tagged/projects), Ryan's project website. His use case is related to cybernetics and control theory, see [Stafford Beer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer), see ["Cybernetic Revolutionaries"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cybernetic-revolutionaries#:~:text=Summary-,A%20historical%20study%20of%20Chile's%20twin%20experiments%20with%20cybernetics%20and,one%20political%20and%20one%20technological.) by Eden Medina.

### Conclusion 

Either make plugins for Joplin because it's open source and cross-platform. This gives independence to develop the features next to Joplin. Or use a script like [this](https://gitlab.com/annyong/baeuda) to generate flash cards. Do plugins work on mobile?

Or extend Joplin, however it's unlikely that Joplin core would want all those features.

Or use Obsidian because it looks so good and while it doesn't have flashcards.
And extend Obsidian with a script to generate flashcards from the markdown files. However this is not truly cross-platform.

Or make a new product. This is the only approach that can be taken to implement all functionality. However implementing all features is a mammoth task. Maybe forking Joplin is an option. A new product in Flutter/Dart would produce a prettier and faster mobile app. However Obsidian uses the JavaScript ecosystem and that app seems good.

A key differentiation could be a free canvas environment similar to OneNote; however there is no good standard for this. Markdown by contrast is a clear standard.

Or study for your exams.
